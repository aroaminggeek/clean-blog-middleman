# Clean Blog for Middleman

This is my conversion of the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).  
There are [many](https://github.com/sandiegoscott/middleman-clean-blog) versions [like it](https://github.com/Devahoy/middlehoy), but this one is mine.  
My code is ugly. It is not pro-level by any stretch. I will master it as I master my ruby skills.  


The things I've modified or added:  
* Google Analytics
* Social & sharing buttons for each post (facebook, twitter, reddit, email)
* Various configurable settings via `data/site.yml`  
   * siteurl 
   * sitename  
   * subtitle  
   * author  
   * google_tracking_id (*comment out and it won't be included in the partial*) 
   * twitter   
   * facebook   
   * github   

Feel free to fork and modify it to suite your own site needs.
