# Clean Blog for Middleman

This is my conversion of the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).  
There are [many](https://github.com/sandiegoscott/middleman-clean-blog) versions [like it](https://github.com/Devahoy/middlehoy), but this one is mine.  

The things I've modified or added:  
* Optional Google Analytics
* Social share buttons for each post
* Various configurable settings via `data/site.yml`  
   * siteurl: http://localhost:4567  
   * sitename: Your Site  
   * subtitle: A Middleman Template  
   * author: The Middleman  
   * #google_tracking_id: '86-75309-9'  
   * twitter: twitter_handle  
   * facebook: facebook_id  
   * github: github_user  

Feel free to fork and modify it to suite your own site needs.
