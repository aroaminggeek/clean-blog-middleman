**Lunesta Darling:** I don't know if it's going to work on the wall.  
**The Sandman:** What won't work on the wall?  
**Lunesta Darling:** The thermostat.  
**The Sandman:** Why won't the thermostat work?  
**Lunesta Darling:** Because the dragon is in the same room.  
**The Sandman:** Well, we can always move the dragon.  
**Lunesta Darling:** (*frustrated*) No, I'm not explaining myself very well...  
**The Sandman:**  Take your time. What do you mean?  
**Lunesta Darling:**  The dragon on *you*. I don't think the thermostat will work because it's in the room.  
**The Sandman:**  (*realizing she is talking about his dragon tattoo*) It will work fine. If it doesn't work tonight, we'll move the dragon.  
**Lunesta Darling:**  Yeah?  
**The Sandman:**  Yeah.  
**Lunesta Darling:**  Okay, good.
